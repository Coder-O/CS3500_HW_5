What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?
Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for your customers?
After working with our providerâ€™s code, we realized that our design was using a lot of classes,
which can make it difficult to understand. However, we believe we kept them organized and
well-documented, so it should not have been that much of an issue. Additionally, we realized
some of our methods were taking in class implementations instead of their respective interfaces,
but we replaced those with the interfaces and sent that to our customers.

What was your experience like with your providers?
Our experience was positive, they sent their initial interfaces on time and were very open
to answering questions and sending us information when we needed. They also checked in multiple
times to see if we were having any issues understanding their code or getting it to work.
Additionally, when they made any improvements to the code they would send it to us.
